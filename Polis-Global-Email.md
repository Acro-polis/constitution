# Polis.global Email Policy

## Summary

We all use uniform email addresses for our internal and external communication; either an @polis.global address, or one tailored to a specific project.

## Details

Using a mix of personal email addresses for our external communication does not convey an image of a unified professional organisation. This policy proposes that each of us either uses an @polis.global address or an address at the domain of one of our projects. These uniform addresses are then also used for our internal communication.
