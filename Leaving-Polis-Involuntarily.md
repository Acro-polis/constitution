## The Policy

  

At Polis, we intend to give everyone the possibility and guidance to improve performance, behaviors and relationships as much as needed. However, in some cases that doesn’t lead to the desired result. This Policy provides guidance for those cases and describes a process for how to deal with them.

  

Some examples of these cases that could lead to involuntarily departing of a Polis member are;

  

- A member is structurally underperforming and the Improvement Plan did not help to resolve this. (see Underperforming member Policy)  
- A member is not aligned with the rest of the team/organization, attempts to realign by creating an Improvement Plan, hasn’t closed that gap.

- A member does something that the rest of Polis feels is unacceptable, e.g. stealing, violating the Non Disclosure Agreement or other inappropriate behavior.

- The relationship between the member and Polis has been damaged too much and a fruitful collaboration is not possible anymore.

  
  

## Process for involuntarily leaving Polis

We differentiate in process between the Active Participant and Worker-Owner role. Each case will differ, and therefore it is important to make sure the solutions and processes are customized to fit the needs of the team and the departing member. To emphasize that there are several steps that are marked as optional. Teams are encouraged to decide for themselves if that step is appropriate for the specific situation.

  
  
  

**Active Participant**

  

The team or person responsible for hiring the Active Participant can decide to terminate their contract when performance or the work relationship isn’t at the level that is required to complete the project successfully and the efforts to improve aren’t successful. The team or person responsible for hiring the Active Participant, will do the following things;

  

1. Confront the Active Participant and share the reasons for ending the relationship prematurely.

  

2. Create a plan to transfer any relevant information and tasks from Active Participant to the team.

  

3. Optional: Conduct a Retrospective with departing Active Participant, focused on the [team and] organization.

  

4. Optional: group appreciation session

  
  
  
  

**Worker-Owner**

  

The **team** of the Worker-Owner that is underperforming, showing unacceptable behavior, or damaged the relationship with Polis too much, is responsible for informing that Worker-Owner. There are two options:

  

1. **Option A**: There is still a chance of improvement.

 
> > 1. Improvement Plan is created such as described in the Underperforming Member Policy.
> > 2. Team meets with the rest Worker-Owners and evaluate the outcome of the improvement period.
> > 3. Vote is held by all Worker-Owners to decide upon the future of the relationship with the underperforming Worker-Owner.
> > 4. Once the recommendation by the Worker-Owners is negative, the team informs the underperforming Worker-Owner.
> > 5. Optional: Conduct a Retrospective with departing Active Participant, focused on the [team and] organization.
> > 6. Optional: group appreciation session

  
  

2. **Option B:** The Worker-Owner has done something that is unacceptable.

  
  

> 1. The existing Worker-Owners observe unacceptable behavior, and initiate an emergency meeting with all other Worker-Owners.
> 2. This meeting is intended to discuss the situation and come up with a customized process for each specific case. E.g. Immediately firing  and revoking access when someone has been caught stealing.

  
  
  

# Informing the rest of the organization;

  

To create transparency and receive help when necessary, it is important to inform the other Worker-Owners by sharing details and updates. This should be done in

  

1. If it regards an Active Participant, the #Worker-Owner channel should be used. Active Participants do not have access to that channel, so that an open discussion about the plans can be held.

  

2. If the member is a Worker-Owner a new and private channel should be created and all (except for one) Worker-Owners should be invited. This channel should be created by the Worker-Owner(s) observing the unacceptable behavior, and allows the other Worker-Owners to quickly communicate and coordinate the steps that need to be taken.

  
  

**What if the member does not agree? **

If the member does not agree with the opinion of the team and raising that with the team does not lead to the desired alignment, the member should discuss this with the Teamcoach.  
. When, for whatever reason, the member does not feel comfortable sharing this with the Teamcoach, or the Teamcoach can not provide the services they require of them, the member can alternatively contact the person that is mentioned in the Anti-Harassment Policy [https://github.com/Acro-polis/constitution/blob/master/anti-harassment-Policy.md](https://github.com/Acro-polis/constitution/blob/master/anti-harassment-Policy.md) as being the Safe Listener. That “Safe Listener” can take appropriate next steps such as scheduling a group discussion with all Worker-Owners.
