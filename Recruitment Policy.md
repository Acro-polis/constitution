## The Policy

The recruitment Policy for Polis is that every team (that owns a budget), is free to hire new Aspiring Worker-Owners or Contributors*, if the following conditions are met;

  

1.  They new member will be paid from the teams-budget, so the hiring team needs to have enough money to do such a thing.
    
2.  The decision needs to be democratically approved by the team. This can be done by using the teams regular decision making method.
    
3.  If a new Aspiring Worker-Owner or Contributor needs to become an employee of Polis, then this potentially has an impact on the other teams of Polis, and therefore this decision needs to be approved by the other Worker-Owners using the standard [Proposal & Voting](https://github.com/Acro-polis/constitution/blob/master/Proposals-and-Voting-Policy.md) Policy of Polis.
    
4.  The Hiring team has followed the general steps as mentioned in the [Recruitment Process Wiki](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mtOxllsFE_SgXmHcEx6EoBNVYebCbB2WmnJsBj-EBSs/edit#) e.g;

    1.  Appointing a Recruitment facilitator
        
    2.  Created a Recruitment Plan
        
    3.  The candidate has been approved using the standard decision making method of the team
        
    4.  Information about the recruitment process have been shared with the rest of the organization
        
    5.  A plan for onboarding the new candidate has been created.  
          
    

* Please note that new members can not become Worker-Owner immediately after joining. For more details on how to become a Worker-Owner, please see the [Becoming a Worker-Owner Policy.](https://github.com/Acro-polis/constitution/blob/Becoming-a-Worker-Owner/BecomingWorkerOwnerPolicy.md)
