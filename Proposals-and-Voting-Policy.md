# Proposals and Voting Policy
## Details 
**Voted and approved, once necessary changes were made: see [this thread](https://dekai.slack.com/archives/CJMBGF4QY/p1560933342033400) to find details**  

Additional information and guidelines can be found in the wiki https://wiki.polis.global/proposals-voting

## Proposals and Voting Policy
All members can create a proposal and invite other members to a vote, in order to either:
+ Accept a new policy
+ Update an existing policy
+ Enact a vote as described in a policy
+ Out-of-band decisions (e.g. where are we going to have the next team building event)
 
Any member who wants to create a proposal will make use of the different methods as they are described in this policy. These methods are organized to match each specific phase of the proposal process. These phases are: "Creating and sharing a proposal", "Voting on a proposal" and "Adopting a proposal".
Within each of these phases there are described two methods, one for asynchronous shared proposals and one for synchronous shared proposals. 

## Creating and Sharing proposals
### Creating and sharing a Asynchronous proposal 
Members should follow these steps:
1. Post your proposal in the appropriate channel in Slack.   
   * Use the [#vote channel](https://dekai.slack.com/messages/CJMBGF4QY/convo/GFSPHBCGM-1559145174.028400/) for proposals that concern the 
entire organization.
   * Use the team channel for proposals for a specific team.  

2. Use the template in this [Wiki](https://wiki.polis.global/proposals-voting/proposal-sharing) for sharing the proposal in Slack.   


3. **The proposer must remind the members who didn’t cast their vote two days before the deadline. By mentioning them in the thread of the 
proposal by using the @name function of Slack**  
The intention for this reminder is twofold:  
    * To motivate the people who haven’t interacted with the proposal yet to cast their vote. 
    Do this in an inviting manner by asking them if they need anything to help them come to a vote.  
    * The reminder gives every member that voted already the chance to see the information that has been added by the questions 
    others asked, and to revise their vote if necessary.

### Creating a proposal synchronously  
When creating and sharing a proposal synchronously, the proposer should provide answers to any of the relevant questions as listed in the template earlier. 

## Voting on a proposal 
### Voting on a Asynchronous proposal   
In the voting phase, two methods are available: interact with the proposal by using Slack’s thread function or by voting with emoticons. 
* You can use the thread function to:  
   * Make suggestions to add to the proposal
   * Ask clarifying questions in an open and neutral manner, which will benefit everyone else in Polis. 
   The intention of asking clarifying questions should be to understand the original proposal better. 
* Use emoticons to cast a vote, as shown in the wiki. However, please feel reassured that this big table becomes quite easy to use after a few tries. Add these emoticons by using the “adding a reaction” function of Slack. You can find a table containing all the emoticons we use in this [Voting using Emoticons Wiki](https://wiki.polis.global/proposals-voting/voting-using-emoticons) 

### Accepting a Asynchronous proposal 
The following rules apply for a vote to be accepted
1. At least 70% of those eligible to state a position have to do so to before the deadline of the proposal to move forward. 
2. If the 70% threshold has been reached, and there are members that did not state a position after receiving a reminder, those members will automatically be seen as if they are "abstaining" from voting. By doing so the rest of the organization can keep moving forward. 
3. A proposal will be approved if 70% of those stating a position, have voted in favour of the proposal, and nobody blocked the proposal. 

**Note:** If a member forgets to vote on a proposal, which they would normally block or vote against, they are empowered and strongly encouraged to propose an alternative or improved version of the policy, even if this is after the original proposal has been accepted. This way the wisdom of the minority can still be added to the policy so that everyone can benefit from that. 

### Voting on a Synchronous proposal  
Now that the proposal is being put to a vote in a synchronous manner, the following method can be used: 
1. The original proposal is presented by the proposer.
2. All members listen and get the chance to ask clarifying questions. When there are no more questions, the proposal is summarized and a vote is initiated. 
3. All the members can cast their vote by using hand gestures (See [Wiki](https://wiki.polis.global/proposals-voting/voting-using-emoticons))

4. When members want to add things to the proposal, they now get the chance to share it. The facilitator of the meeting sees to it that everybody gets their chance to share. 
5. The creator of the original proposal can decide if they would like to add the thing that was offered by one of the other members. 
   * When they accept -> This new proposal is immediately put to a vote again. 
   * If they do not accept the addition -> Then the original proposal + addition becomes a counter-proposal. There will be a new round 
   of voting between the two options. 

### Accepting a Synchronous proposal 
The following rules apply for a vote to be accepted
1. At least 70% of those eligible to vote, have to present at the moment of the vote. 
2. A proposal will be approved if 70% of those stating a position, have voted in favour of the proposal, and nobody blocked the proposal. 

**Note:** If a member forgets to vote on a proposal, which they would normally block or vote against, they are empowered and strongly encouraged to propose an alternative or improved version of the policy, even if this is after the original proposal has been accepted. This way the wisdom of the minority can still be added to the policy so that everyone can benefit from that. 



## Completing a proposal process/adopting a proposal 
When all the votes have been counted, the result needs to be shared, and follow-up actions need to be taken. 

### Asynchronously adopting a proposal 
Once everybody has reacted to the vote, or the deadline of the proposal has been reached, the proposer will share the outcome in the 
thread of the proposal. This message should contain:  
* @here, to notify all members
* A summary of the outcome 
* The follow-up actions that will be taken
   * For example: “This policy will now be added to the Membership Policy”
   
### Synchronously adopting a proposal 
Once everybody has cast their vote, the facilitator will summarize the decision that has been made and the follow-up actions 
that will be taken. Both of these will be added to the notes of the meeting.
