# Policy/agreement
We agree that the onboarding period of a new member is focussed on cultivating a relationship between the new member, the team and 
the rest of the organization. So that any new member feels comfortable and safe, can participate and contribute to their team and the rest 
of the organization from the moment they join Polis.
