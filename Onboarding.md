# Onboarding Policy
We agree that the onboarding period of a new member is focussed on cultivating a relationship between the new member, the team and the rest of the organization. This relationship should contribute to making new member feel comfortable and safe, allowing them to participate, contribute and add value to their team and the rest of the organization from the moment they join Polis.
