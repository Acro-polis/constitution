## The Policy
The intention of this Policy is to agree that we, if a member is underperforming, intend to focus on finding solutions and improve the member’s capabilities to perform their responsibilities in Polis. This policy provides a process that facilitates that, and enables (underperforming) members to grow and develop themselves, automatically stimulating their performance level.

  

**Worker-Owner that is underperforming**

When a Worker-Owner’s quality or quantity of performance is not at the level that is required, it is important to keep the following things in mind:

  

-   The team of the Worker-Owner is responsible for concluding that the person’s performance isn’t at the required level, and should share that observation with the member they believe is underperforming.
    
-   The team should intend to come up with a plan to increase the Worker-Owner’s abilities to perform, whether in the area of technical or social skills.
    

  

When a Worker-Owner is underperforming the following steps should be taken.

1.  The team will have a meeting with the ‘underperformer’ and during that meeting they share their observations, and together develop a plan which is focussed on improving the capabilities of the ‘underperformer’, including definite time-lines and behaviors expected. (If desired, the Team-coach could join the meeting as a facilitator/mediator)  
      
    
2.  If in the period after that it becomes clear that there is no significant improvement, either because the ‘underperformer’ is not willing or able to improve, the team can initiate a meeting with the rest of Polis’ Worker-Owners in which the team explains what they did and makes a proposal for the future of the relationship with that specific Worker-Owner. (E.g. end the relationship/continue as active-participant/ or other suggestions.)  
      
    
3.  The other Worker-Owners will during that meeting ask questions about the proposal, can make suggestions to improve it, and then all present will cast their vote.

**Active Participant that is underperforming**

  

The team or person responsible for hiring the Active Participant can decide to terminate the contract when performance or the working relationship isn’t at the level that is required to complete the project successfully. However, it is encouraged to use the same process as is set forth above for an underperforming Worker-Owner to create a plan to improve and enable the Active Participant to improve. Again, the following things are important to keep in mind:  
  

-   The team or member who assigned the task, is responsible for concluding that the Active Participant’s performance isn’t at the required level, and sharing that observation with the Participant that is underperforming.
    
-   The team should intend to come up with a plan to increase the Participant’s abilities to perform; this can be focussed on technical, social or other skills.
