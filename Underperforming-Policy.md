## The Policy
The intention of this Policy is to create clarity for how to proceed when a member is underperforming, the process is intended to focus on finding solutions and improve the member’s capabilities to perform their responsibilities in Polis. This policy provides a process that facilitates that, and enables (underperforming) members to grow and develop themselves, automatically stimulating their performance level. The process is intended to function as a last resort, and should be used if other attempts to provide someone with feedback did not succeed. 

**When is somebody underperforming?** 
Deciding this will be different in each specific case and will therefore be hard to measure objectively. Generally speaking a member is underperforming when; 
They do not keep the (team-)agreements .
They constantly miss deadlines without having a reasonable explanation.
They do not respond to feedback that is given during other moments, e.g. retrospectives or 1:1 sessions. 


**Worker-Owner that is underperforming**

When a Worker-Owner’s quality or quantity of performance is not at the level that is required, it is important to keep the following things in mind:


-   The team of the Worker-Owner is responsible for concluding that the person’s performance isn’t at the required level, and should share that observation with the member they believe is underperforming.

-   The team is responsible for making sure an ‘Improvement plan” is created so that the Worker-Owners abilities to perform can be increased. The plan can be focussed on  technical, communicative or other skills, and preferably is created by the Underperforming Member, if they do not take initiative in creating the plan the team is responsible for helping them create the improvement plan. 


When a Worker-Owner is underperforming the following steps should be taken.

1.  The team will have a meeting with the underperforming member and during that meeting they share their observations, and together develop an improvement plan which is focussed on improving the capabilities of the underperforming member, including definite time-lines and behaviors expected. (If desired, the Team-coach could join the meeting as a facilitator/mediator)  
2. The improvement plan should be shared in the public Team-channel on Slack, so that other Worker-Owners can see if the agreements that were made are fair. 


3.  If in the period after that it becomes clear that there is no significant improvement, either because the underperforming member is not willing or able to improve, the team can initiate a meeting with the rest of Polis’ Worker-Owners in which the team explains what they did and makes a proposal for the future of the relationship with that specific Worker-Owner. (E.g. end the relationship/continue as active-participant/ or other suggestions.)  


4.  The other Worker-Owners will during that meeting ask questions about the proposal, can make suggestions to improve it, and then all present will cast their vote.

**Active Participant that is underperforming**



The team or person responsible for hiring the Active Participant can decide to terminate the contract when performance or the working relationship isn’t at the level that is required to complete the project successfully. However, it is encouraged to use the same process as is set forth above for an underperforming Worker-Owner to create an “Improvement plan” to  enable the Active Participant to improve. Again, the following things are important to keep in mind:  


-   The team or member who assigned the task, is responsible for concluding that the Active Participant’s performance isn’t at the required level, and sharing that observation with the Participant that is underperforming.

-   The team is responsible for making sure an ‘Improvement plan” is created so that the Participant’s abilities to perform can be increased. The plan can be focussed on  technical, communicative or other skills, and preferably is created by the Underperforming Member, if they do not take initiative in creating the plan the team is responsible for helping them create the improvement plan. 



**What if the underperforming member does not agree?** 
If the alleged underperforming member does not agree with the opinion of the team about their performance or with the plan in general, they should share this with the Teamcoach. When, for whatever reason, the member does not feel comfortable sharing this with the Teamcoach, they can alternatively contact the person that is mentioned in the Anti-Harassment Policy https://github.com/Acro-polis/constitution/blob/master/anti-harassment-Policy.md as being the safe listener.
