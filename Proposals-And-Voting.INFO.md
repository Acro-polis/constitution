# Proposals and Voting INFO

## Purpose 

We are a democratic organization. To make sure every member can voice their opinions and share their unique ideas with the rest of the organization, we need clear methods and processes to facilitate that. These methods should provide clarity and should strive to add the knowledge and perspectives of the minority to everyone’s consideration, so that the rest of the organization or team can benefit. 


## Guides / Procedures
### Choosing the right method for your proposal 
There are two different methods, synchronously or asynchronously, for creating and sharing a proposal.
The proposer decides which method is used to initiate the proposal. During the process of voting and discussing the proposal,
it can be decided that there is a need to change the method and, for example, have a discussion about a document that was shared
asynchronously. 

**How to choose which method to use for sharing your proposal**  
A member who wants to create a proposal should always strive to use the method which best suits the goal of the proposal. 
In general, both methods have positives and negatives:  
* Asynchronous sharing and voting  
   * :heavy_plus_sign: Easy to organize, everybody can look at the proposal at their preferred time. 
   * :heavy_plus_sign: Larger documents can be shared easily.
   * :heavy_plus_sign: Members can think longer before interacting with the proposal. 
   * :heavy_plus_sign: The discussion about the proposal is saved in Slack. This makes it easier to keep track of why decisions were made. 
   * :heavy_minus_sign: Potential of misinterpreting text of proposal.
   * :heavy_minus_sign: Harder to add suggestions to a proposal, because people already might have cast their vote before the suggestion was made. (Could be overcome by notifying members that already cast their vote)
   * :heavy_minus_sign: Can slow down the speed of the process because a proposal could be adjusted along the way. This undoes the votes of the members who cast their vote before these adjustments were made. 
    
* Synchronous sharing and voting  
Synchronous sharing and voting 
   * :heavy_plus_sign: Easier to discuss and add suggestions to the original proposal. 
   * :heavy_plus_sign: Easier to ask questions that help clarify the proposal
   * :heavy_plus_sign: Easier to notice misunderstandings about the proposal (Direct feedback from being able to speak and see other members).
   * :heavy_plus_sign: Decisions can be made quickly.
   * :heavy_minus_sign: Harder to organize (especially if people are in different time-zones). 
   * :heavy_minus_sign: Members will often have to voice their opinion and decide on the spot, and therefore have less time to go through the proposal.
   * :heavy_minus_sign: Members are more prone to group pressure. 
   * :heavy_minus_sign: Harder to capture the whole discussion.

**When uncertain which method to use** 
IYou can ask other members for advice, or you could ask themselves the following questions: 
 * What would you prefer if you were the one having to vote on this proposal? 
 * What helps improve the quality of the proposal the most? 
 * What is the most important: speed, quality or discussion? 
 * Which method helps the other persons understand the proposal as best as possible? 
 * What do the other members need to understand this proposal? 


**Combining or switching between methods**
The proposer is responsible for choosing the initial method of sharing the proposal.
However it may occur that the initial method turns out to be not effective in coming to a decision on the proposal. 
This isn’t a good or bad thing; however it requires adjusting the process that was started. Some examples and how to act:
* An asynchronously shared proposal leads to so many (detailed) questions that it is more efficient to have an in-person meeting.
   * Preferably the original proposer will notice this; if not, then any member can propose to create a meeting about the proposal. 
That can be done by replying to the thread of the original proposal. If others agree, a meeting will be scheduled by the proposer. 
The proposer is then responsible for planning the meeting and notifying all members when that meeting will take place.  
* A synchronously shared proposal turns out to be very hard to decide upon on the spot. Members might feel that they need more time to 
think about it before they can form an opinion. 
   * The facilitator of the meeting or the proposer himself can then propose to postpone voting for the proposal until the next meeting 
or for asynchronous voting. Important is that the group involved in the proposal has achieved consensus about the next step,
when and how it will take place. For example: 
“Instead of voting on my original proposal, I’d like to suggest that we do an alternative vote. I will share my proposal in 
the team channel today, and all of you would cast a vote before our next meeting. All in favor, please raise your hand”.
