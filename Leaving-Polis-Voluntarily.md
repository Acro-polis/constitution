## The Policy
This Policy defines a clear process which facilitates a smooth transition of a member into a different Polis team or exiting of Polis entirely. The intention of this process is to maintain healthy relationships between the team and the leaving member during and after the transition, and to minimize any potential disruption related to this transition to the organization, team, goals or processes. It also allows Polis to grow from the unique perspective of the leaving member.

## Voluntarily leaving Polis

**Worker-Owner & Active Participants**  
Any Worker-Owner or Active Participant can decide to leave the organization. They do have to abide by any contractual agreements that have been made regarding prematurely cancelling their contract.

## Process of leaving Polis voluntarily

Any member that leaves the organization or their team will complete the following steps:

1.  The leaving member informs their team in a timely manner:    

1.  Inform team members about your intended departure and schedule a meeting
    
2.  In that meeting the leaving member and their team discuss and formulate a plan to transfer information and tasks, and a Facilitator for the plan is chosen.    

3.  The leaving member inform the rest of Polis via Slack using the #_general channel
    
4.  The facilitating member of the team will conduct a Retrospective with the leaving member, focused on the [team and] organization.
    
5.  Optional: group appreciation session.
    

In [this Wiki](https://wiki.polis.global/leaving-the-organization/voluntarily) you can find guidelines for how to complete each of the above steps.
