# Constitution
Our constitution consists of all the policies we agreed to by voting on them.   
Each Policy consists out of two files. 
1. _"(Topic)Policy"_ file in which the agreement is described. 
   * This also contains a link to the <topic>Info file.  
   * Any changes to the Policy need to be approved by voting on them by everyone in the organization
   
2. _"(Topic)Info"_ file in which additional information such as the purpose and procedures of a policy are shared. 
The intention of this file is to provide context and help practice the things we've agreed upon in the related Policy.
   * The information and guides in this file can be changed and improved by anyone
