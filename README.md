# Constitution
Our constitution consists of all the policies we agreed to by voting on them.   
Each policy has the following contents:  

_"(Topic) Policy"_ in which the agreement is described. 
   * When added to the master branch, the branch that contains all the accepted policies, the Policy should start with a "Details" paragraph. That contains a link to the original proposal thread in Slack and a link to the wiki where more Guidelines and information can be found.
   * Any changes to the Policy need to be approved by voting on them by everyone in the organization.
   * The wiki's contents can change without the regular voting process and can be changed and improved by anyone. The intention of this file is to provide context and help practice the things we've agreed upon in the related Policy. You can find the Wiki's here: http://wiki.polis.global/
