2. Though shall give written stand-up posts in the AI Slack channel https://app.slack.com/client/T5XBZ3R63/C5Y0J0951 If you fail to do that, you shall write a more detailed description. 
3. If you do not decline the meeting invitation via Google Calendar, we expect you to be there! 
If you want to reschedule a meeting, you tag everyone that was invited for the original meeting invite via Slack and propose an alternative date.
