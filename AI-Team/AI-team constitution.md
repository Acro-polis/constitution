# AI's Team constitution 
This team constiution functions as a shared place for the agreements we make to further stimulate our colaborative skills. 

1. Though shall not end the day without committing code when code was written. 
2. Though shall give written stand-up posts in the AI Slack channel https://app.slack.com/client/T5XBZ3R63/C5Y0J0951  Start your message with :postal_horn: (:postal_horn :) so that the others can easily find your updates! 
If you fail to do that, you shall write a more detailed description.  
3. If you do not decline the meeting invitation via Google Calendar, we expect you to be there! 
If you want to reschedule a meeting, you tag everyone that was invited for the original meeting invite via Slack and propose an alternative date.
