## Practical guide for onboarding new members 
The member of Polis responsible for the Practical aspect of onboarding new members will complete the following steps. 

+ Share the Polis Wiki [Polis Wiki](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19oL6IzqqLaHaZbgdrLEHkFwED8LhYQXLrqR8kOKVlYg/edit#) with new members   
  * In this wiki new members can learn more about the “practical” side of Polis. 
+ Facilitate that the new member receives access to the right digital environments. 
  * Use [this list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LERvILvmFgCVWLB2yRiTdYHcAWybr9mTVPaXcR9m3T8/edit) to see what those environments are, for which teams those are available and who can provide this access.
+ Facilitate in connecting the new member to a Mentor.
