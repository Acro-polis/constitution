# Calling In Sick Info

## Procedures
When you, due to sickness, can’t attend meetings or can’t perform the tasks that are expected of you, we expect that you do two things:  
1. You inform your teammates or other people that are directly affected by your absence in any way.  
2. Send a message in the [#call_in_sick channel](https://dekai.slack.com/messages/CHQ24TLDQ/) in Slack, and in that message tag @Angela so 
that she’s made aware of your absence. She will make sure your sick leave is administrated propoerly.
