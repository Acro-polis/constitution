## The Policy 
This policy describes how the compensation for sick-leave is organzied within Polis. 
## Compensation 
At this moment in our organization we do not have the resources to do the research and acquire the knowledge that is needed for a compensation system that will be more inclusive and will take account laws in specific countries.  Therefore we have created this temporary Policy so that we can at least bridge that period and provide some clarity already. 
1. Dutch laws requires us to pay sick leave for *employees*.  
2. Active participants will not receive compensation for sick-leave. 

### Worker owners - fulltime 
*Employed* full time worker owners have the right to receive their full salary when they are sick. For the first year 100% and for the second year 70% of their gross salary. This way we abide Dutch law.  
Compensation for sick-leave is not part of the contract *Contractors* receive at this moment.  Our goal is to realize this in the coming 12 months. We need to find out the legal possibilities in each country for this, or find other ways for bridging this gap. 

### Worker owners - part time Employees
The *employed* part time worker owners have the right of compensation of the days they are sick and normally would have worked for the project. The compensation is the same 100% of their gross salary for the first year and 70% for the second year. This will be calculated by taking the last 13 weeks they worked and averaging out the amount of hours they worked. 

For the part time *contracted* worker owners there is no compensation at this moment but our goal is to realize this in the coming 12 months. We need to find out the legal possibilities in each country for this, or find other ways for bridging this gap. 

### Active participants
There is no compensation for sick days for the active participants.
The active participants get paid for the hours they work on a Project.
