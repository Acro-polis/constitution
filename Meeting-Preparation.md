# Meeting preparation

## Intro
Some polis meetings require preparation. Examples are: making an assignment, reading a document, or forming an opinion about some issue. We want our meetings to be efficient and effective, and often preparation is a requirement for that. Therefore, the goal of this policy is to standardize the way we communicate that preparation is needed.

## Policy
We create calendar invites for every polis meeting. When polis members need to prepare for a meeting, we add preparation instructions in the description of the invite. If the instructions consist of a larger body of text, point to a document.
