# Anywhere on Earth Deadline Policy

## Summary

We use the Anywhere on Earth (AoE) timezone for deadlines that expire on a specific day.

## Details

Since we are an international organisation, setting a deadline to a specific day might cause confusion. Such a deadline would have different meanings in different timezones.

This policy proposes to use the Anywhere on Earth (AoE) timezone for these kinds of deadlines. A deadline set to day X, would not expire until day X has passed for every location on earth. Note that by this definition day X is included in the period before the deadline.
