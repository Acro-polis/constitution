## The Policy 
This policy is to make sure every worker owner and active participant knows when and how to call-in-sick and the consequences for payments.

The holiday leave needs to be shared with the team upfront so that is clear when a team member is on holiday and not everybody is 
leaving at the same time. The work that needs to be done should be handed over on time so that team members know what to do and 
save time to do it.

## Compensation 
Dutch laws requires us to pay sick leave for *employees*. Therefore there is a difference in compensation at this moment between employees and contractors that are Worker Owners. We feel that this is a temporary solution, because it requires a lot of research and knowledge of laws in specific countries to create a more inclusive solution at this point.


### Worker owners - fulltime
*Employed* full time worker owners have the right to receive their full salary when they are sick. For the first year 100% and for the second year 70% of their gross salary.

 For the contracted full time worker owners the compensation is the same except that the contracted worker owners have a standard of days off in one year and they use it for sick leave, holiday and public holiday.

### Worker owners - part time
The *employed* part time worker owners have the right of compensation of the days they are sick and normally would have worked for the project. The compensation is the same 100% of their gross salary for the first year and 70% for the second year.

For the part time contracted worker owners there is no compensation at this moment but our goal is to realize this in the coming 12 months. We need to find out the legal possibilities in each country for this.

### Active participants
There is no compensation for sick days for the active participants.
The active participants get paid for the hours they worked for the Project.
