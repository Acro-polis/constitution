## The Policy

This policy describes the process of how to share changes regarding your personal information of that of your emergency contact. 

### Update personal information

Everyone is required to personally inform Angela Wante via email (aaenfd@gmail.com) or Slack if any of your personal information or that of your emergency contact changes. 
For example: 
- Civil status
- Name change
- Address
- Phone number 
- Email address

Angela gathers all this personal information and makes sure that the information is up to date. 
To keep into account everyone's privacy all of this information is not shared on our Google drive, but is only shared with Ruben DaniÃ«ls, Esther Filipowicz and Angela Wante.
