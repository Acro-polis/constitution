## The Policy 
This Policy describes how vacation hours are being compensated and how one should communicate about being absent due to holidays.


## Compensation 

At this moment in our organization we do not have the resources to do the research and acquire the knowledge that is needed for a compensation system that will be more inclusive and will take account laws in specific countries. Therefore we have created this temporary Policy so that we can at least bridge that period and provide some clarity already. For now we know that; 
1. Dutch law requires us to give our employees an x amount of vacation hours. 
2. Active participants do not receive compensation for their vacation hours. 


### Employed worker owners - fulltime
*Employed* full time worker owners have the right of 25 vacation days per year, this is based on a 40-hour work week. They can use it whenever they want. Full time worker owners also have the right to take time off on Public Holidays and receive compensation for that. 
 
For the *Contracted* full time worker owners the compensation is the same except that the contracted worker owners have a standard amount of days off in one year and they use it for vacation and public holidays accordingly.

### Worker owners - part time
For the *employed* part time worker owners we are obliged to follow Dutch law. Therefore they will receive 0,08 vacation hours for each worked hour (13 work hours needed to save up for 1 hour vacation).

For the part time *contracted* worker owners there is no compensation at this moment but our goal is to realize this in the coming  12 months. This is because it requires time We need to find out the legal possibilities in each country for this.

### Active participants
There is no compensation for vacation for the active participants. The active participants get paid for the hours they work on a Project.

## Process
Every member of Polis, either Active participant or Worker-owner should communicate their absence due to vacation in the following manner, so that everyone can enjoy their holiday without being disturbed. 
1. Mention your holiday in the shared Polis Holiday agenda. 
2. Share your holiday with your team or others affected by your absence in a timely manner so that you can transfer work that needs to be continued during your absence to your team members. 
3. Use the wiki [https://wiki.polis.global/en/Administration Guidelines](https://wiki.polis.global/en/Administration%20Guidelines) to administrate your vacation hours in the right way to receive compensation.
