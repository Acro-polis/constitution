## The Policy 
Everybody (worker owner or active participant) needs to mention the holiday leave in the Polis agenda. 
This way, everybody can see who is on holiday and donâ€™t disturb them while enjoying their holiday.

The holiday leave needs to be shared with the team upfront so that is clear when a team member is on holiday and not everybody is 
leaving at the same time. The work that needs to be done should be handed over on time so that team members know what to do and 
save time to do it.



Dutch laws requires us to pay holiday leave for employees fulltime and parttime. Therefore there is a difference in compensation at 
this moment between employees and contractors that are Worker Owners. We feel that this is a temporary solution, but because it 
requires a lot of research and knowledge of laws in specific countries we are not able to create a more inclusive solution at this point.

## Worker owners - fulltime

*Employed* full time worker owners have the right of 25 vacation days per year, this is based on a 40-hour work week. They can use 
it whenever they want. Full time worker owners also have the right to take time off on Public Holidays and receive compensation for that. 
 
For the *Contracted* full time worker owners the compensation is the same except that the contracted worker owners have a standard 
amount of days off in one year and they use it for sick leave, holiday and public holiday.

## Worker owners - part time

For the *employed* part time worker owners we are obliged to follow Dutch law. Therefore they will receive 0,08 vacation hours for 
each worked hour (13 work hours needed to save up for 1 hour vacation).

 For the part time *contracted* worker owners there is no compensation at this moment but our goal is to realize this in the coming 
 12 months. This is because it requires time We need to find out the legal possibilities in each country for this.

## Active participants

There is no compensation for vacation days for the active participants. The active participants only receive remuneration for the hours
they work on a project.
