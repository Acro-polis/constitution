## The Policy

This policy describes the process and deadlines of updating your working hour administration.

### Update working hour administration

Every Worker-Owner and Contributor needs to fill in their working hour administration every month. These hours are the basis for invoices and salary administration.

The working hour administration needs the following information:

-   The number of hours worked for each day
    
-   A short description of the work that is done
    
-   Sick days
    
-   Holidays
    

*Tip: It is much easier to keep track of your hours every day and it will take less time after the month is ended.*

Your working hour administration needs to be filled in on the **8th day** after the end of a month.

There will be a reminder in the #administration channel in Slack every month. By responding to that reminder you can let everyone know when your hours are up to date.

If the hours are updated on the 8th, the administration can process the hours and make sure your salary is paid. When it is not updated on the 8th the hours and invoices are processed one month later.

### Sending invoices

For those that work on a contracting basis, the deadline for sending the invoices is the **15th day** after the end of the month.

The invoices need to be send to [aaenfd@gmail.com](mailto:aaenfd@gmail.com) and [innovationresearchlabs@gmail.com](mailto:innovationresearchlabs@gmail.com)
