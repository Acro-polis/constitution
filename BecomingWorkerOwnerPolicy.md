## The Policy

This policy describes the process of how Aspiring Worker-Owners & Contributors can become a Worker-Owner.

### From Aspiring Worker-Owner to Worker-Owner

1.  When a person was first hired to become an Aspiring Worker-Owner (Aspiree), the terms of their Transition period were discussed and defined with the members of the team they joined. Once the period has been completed (or the terms have been achieved even before the end of the period), the team of the Aspiree must decide if they will vouch to the rest of Polis, for the Aspiree to become a Worker-Owner.  
    At least 81% of the team’s Worker-Owners have to vouch for the Aspiring Worker-Owner. As always within Polis, the minority will have a chance to share their opinion and thereby add insights to the group decision-making-process that otherwise would be lost.  

The vote can have three different outcomes:
    
	1.  Negative, the team does not vouch for the Aspiree and does not want to continue the relationship with the Aspiree . In practice this situation should be avoided, by having problems addressed as soon as they arise, and therefore before the end of the Transition Period.
    
	2.  Negative, the teams does not vouch for the Aspiree, but they will provide feedback to the Aspiree and create a plan for the Aspiree to manifest the needed improvements during a second Transition Period (which may be a different length of time than was the first).
    
	3.  Positive, the team vouches for the Aspiree and this will start the process for becoming a Worker-Owner. See step 2.  
      
      
    

 -  After vouching for the Aspiring Worker-Owner, the team will post a message in the #_recruitment channel to inform the rest of the organization. This message should contain:
 - A link to the [Recruitment form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mtOxllsFE_SgXmHcEx6EoBNVYebCbB2WmnJsBj-EBSs/edit#)
 - The outcome of the team-vote as a percentage, and a brief description of the reasoning/perspective of the majority & the minority about their choice, mentioning both the Aspiring Worker Owner’s *technical skills* & *performance* and their p*articipatory-democratic* cultural abilities (including describing instances when those were applied).
 - A link to the Transition Period Terms document which includes an evaluation on how the Aspiring Worker-Owner has performed on those predefined Transition Terms.
 -  A written statement of max 500 words by the team outlining why the Aspiring Worker-Owner will be of value to the rest of the organization.
 - The team is responsible for scheduling a ‘Hiring a Worker-Owner Meeting’ (whose details are in Step 3) and announces the time and date in this message.       
    
            
    
          
      
 *The invited Worker-Owners will use this information to prepare for the ‘Hiring a Worker-Owner Meeting’.*  

  

3.  The ‘Hiring a Worker-Owner Meeting’ can only be valid when at least 6 Worker-Owners are present, and at least 2 to 3 members of the Work-team that is vouching for the Aspiree are present. [We are aware and will happily revise this policy when any current team with a specific product mission (Nangu/Memri) becomes an entity.] 
During the ‘Hiring a Worker-Owner Meeting’ the initiators share their experiences and motivations, and the other attendees can ask questions. This meeting will be recorded, and shared in the specific #_recruitment channel.   
      
    
4.  After the ‘Hiring a Worker-Owner Meeting’, the recruiting team will share a proposal in the #_recruitment (!) channel in which they ask all Worker-Owners to cast a vote about the Aspiree becoming a Worker-Owner. The regular [Proposals and Voting Policy](https://github.com/Acro-polis/constitution/blob/master/Proposals-and-Voting-Policy.md) applies to this.  
      
    

**NB**: If the outcome of the organizational vote is *negative*, the Hiring team is responsible for:

-   Collecting the negative voters’ *reasons* for rejecting the Aspiree’s immediate movement into permanent membership.
    
-   Informing the Aspiring Worker-Owner of the outcome of the vote.
    
-   If the Aspiring Worker-Owner is not accepted as a Worker-Owner, they will get a chance to improve themselves. The Worker-Owners should provide concrete and constructive feedback which helps the Aspiring Worker-Owner learn from this experience and improve what there is to improve, so that they can become a Worker-Owner in the future.  
      
    

**Ending the relationship directly:** In the rare situation that the other Worker-Owners feel the relationship with the Aspiring Worker-Owner should be ended completely, they should propose an [emergency decision](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1t8nkLf2HtH8zKmHlLm2V8BdNcYC5-FswcjMUxTQ_LxU/edit#). This process is completely separate from the Aspiring Worker-Owner to Worker-Owner process, and could be initiated at any time.

  

### From Contributor to Worker-Owner

For a Contributor to become a Worker-Owner, they must have collaborated with Polis for at least two months. After those two months, the process of becoming a Worker-Owner is similar to that of the Aspiring Worker-Owner. The only step that differs is the initial one: 

1.  Whereas the Aspiring Worker-Owner will always have Transition Period, this doesn’t have to be the case for the Contributor who aspires to become a Worker-Owner. The hiring team needs to decide amongst themselves if they want to create an official Transition Period, or if they feel comfortable vouching for the Contributor without any Transition Period stipulations. At least 81% of the team has to vouch for the Contributor.
   
*The rest of the steps will be exactly the same as mentioned in the "From Aspiring Worker-Owner to Worker-Owner" paragraph of this Policy.*
