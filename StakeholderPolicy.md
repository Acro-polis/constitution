## The Policy

This policy identifies the different stakeholder groups we currently have within Polis, and provides links to more specific policies related to the different roles.

## Different levels of influence within the governance of Polis

In the image below, the different rings of influence within the governance of Polis are illustrated. The degree of an individual’s influence on the governance of our organization increases when they come closer to the core. This means that Worker-Owners have the most influence on Polis’ governance.

## Description of each Stakeholder Group

Within Polis we have different stakeholder groups. Members of each group have different rights; therefore it is important to understand what they are, and what differences there are.

  

### Contributor (CO)

The Contributor can be anyone who is working with Polis as a consultant or does specific, time-limited, work on a project. It isn’t their intention to fully join the organization long-term and become a voting member; however, their advice is invited and desired. Their relationship with our organization is usually expected to be temporary.

Contributors can have voting rights for a small subset of issues related to their task/roles, and can’t vote on our Constitutional Policies. On the other hand, their advice on all issues is invited, & valued.  
  

### Aspiring Worker-Owner (A-WO)

An Aspiring Worker-Owner has the intention to become a permanent Worker-Owner in the near future. To become a Worker-Owner, the A-WO needs to complete a transition period, which allows each of the Polis Worker-Owners to find out if the aspiring member has the essential technical, social and democratic-governance skills to become a valuable participant to our organization on a long-term basis.  
Aspiring Worker-Owners can have voting rights for a subset of issues that significantly affect their task/roles, but can’t vote on constitutional policies. On the other hand, their advice on all issues is invited, & valued.

  

### Worker-Owner (WO)

The Worker-Owners are the driving force that combines the value of all contributors towards the noble cause of the organization. They intend to have long-term engagement, and are committed to the long-term success of the organization, they actively participate in the democratic processes and take initiative to improve our procedures & organizational culture.  
The Worker-Owners have voting rights on democratic decisions that pertain to their team and to the larger work environment of the organization; e.g. hiring new Worker-Owners, adopting company policies, and other community wide issues that are not the domain of other stakeholder groups.
