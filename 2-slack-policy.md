# 1 Slack Sharing Policy 
Proposal Accepted during Show & Tell 17th of April 2019
Original proposal thread: You can find here

## 1.1 Purpose 

To stimulate the impact of sharing information within Polis; Koen, Ruben and Bram like to propose some guidelines for sharing items in Slack. We considered this to be an important topic, as our slack behaviour may save or cost team members a lot of time. We aim to provide a set of simple guidelines for sharing on slack, requiring minimal extra work and learning curve.

What we aim to achieve 
Make it easier to prioritize posts, improving efficiency
Minimize double information processing 
Provide insight in who is up to date with what information

## 1.2 Policy

Any member within Polis agrees to use the following procedures to communicate via Slack: 
Use labels to prioritize
Focus on efficient sharing of information
Interact with posts in Slack as described in the procedure

## 1.3 Procedures 
### 1.3.1 Use Labels to prioritize 

When sharing an item, we can use labels to indicate the relevance of the item. For this, we follow the MoSCoW scheme. MoSCoW has been used extensively in agile development and separates topics in Must haves, Should haves, Could haves and Won’t haves. We want to apply the same structure to our shared documents by adding emoticons to shared items:
 * :mushroom: Must haves (: mushroom: in slack)
 * :sweet_potato: Should haves (: sweet_potato: in slack)
 * :cucumber: Could haves (: cucumber: in Slack)
 * 🥃Won’t haves (:whiskey: in Slack) 	

By using labels, you will remove the burden of figuring out the relevance of shared items for team members.
NOTE: Make sure you add the emoticon in the text; otherwise i

### 1.3.2 More efficient sharing
Why? To allow other members to benefit from the effort you already did in reading the document. Hereby, we can prevent that 5 colleagues spend time on work you already did. There are multiple types of information that could be useful to share, of which the relevance may vary per shared item. Some examples of how you can choose to do that are:

Sharing an item in a channel without tagging specific members means; “this is interesting for everyone in the channel” 
You can also address individuals in a channel, using Slack’s @<name> functionality. We prefer this over (group) Direct Messages, as it keeps the discussion open, transparent and creates a history, which can be useful when new members join the channel. This is not possible for new members joining a (group) Direct Messaging in Slack. 
Alternatively, when you end up tagging the same people very often, for instance in team conversations or projects (across teams), you could choose to move the conversation to a separate channel. Again, this is prefered over direct messages in groups, for the same reasons.
By describing briefly what the post is about
Point out what is relevant in the thing you shared by mentioning where the information can be found specifically or at what minute of the video the interesting part starts. So that your colleagues don’t waste time on the wrong parts of a document.
Share why you think it is relevant for the others and what you expect them to do with the post. (e.g. Read it before the next meeting, discuss it, etc.) 

### 1.3.3 Interacting with and reacting on posts in Slack
To keep interactions in Slack organized, structured and efficient we would like to propose these guidelines for interacting with shared items; 
We should aim to let our colleagues know that the shared item reached us. The most simple way to do this is by reacting with an emoticon, a simple :thumbsup: 👍 emoticon is perfectly sufficient. By doing so we can create a better understanding of who read what, which enables members to go into deeper conversation in meetings.
To keep our discussion on a topic in one place, we should use threads.
